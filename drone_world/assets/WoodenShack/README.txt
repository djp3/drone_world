I got this model from 
https://blendswap.com/blend/17209

It needed to have the texture applied to the surface which required opening the
shading view, creating a new Texture/Image node and then connecting it to the
input of the BDSF shader.

I also moved the model a bit along the y axis so that it would be offset from
the position at which it was placed.

Then outputing the model as glb
